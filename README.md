## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 installed on your system.

### Setting up a Virtual Environment

It's always a good practice to use a virtual environment for Python projects to manage dependencies. Here's how to set it up:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root directory of this project.
3. Run the following command to create a virtual environment (replace `myenv` with your preferred environment name):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   ```

### Activate the virtual environment
On Windows:
   ```bash
   myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```
On macOS and Linux:
   ```bash
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```

### Installing Dependencies

Once you have activated the virtual environment, you can install the required dependencies using the requirements.txt
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the script

Run the following command to open Jupyter Notebook. Once it opens in the browser, you can open the file 'analysis.ipynb'
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
